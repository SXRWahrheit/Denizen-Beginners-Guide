### Placeholder

Until this page is written, you can view the [old tutorial video here](https://one.denizenscript.com/denizen/vids/Properties%20and%20Mechanisms).

### The Adjust Command

The `adjust` command is primarily used to adjust entities that are already spawned or otherwise have a unique identifier.

#### The AdjustBlock command

The `adjustblock` command is a variant of normal `adjust` specifically to adjust `material` mechanisms on blocks.

#### How To Adjust Items

**TODO: Explain adjust/adjustblock more, including how `inventory adjust` works, and including what a 'unique identifier' is**

#### Adjusting Definitions

**TODO: Explain `adjust def:x`**

### Properties

"Properties" are a system to track the details of an object that doesn't have a unique identity of its own.

#### Item Properties

The most common place that properties are seen in use is with items.

#### Material Properties

#### Entities Have Properties Too

**TODO: Explain properties more, including the `entity.describe` tag, the idea of tag+mechanism pairs, etc**

Note: most users, especially those learning from the Denizen for the first time, should just continue on to the next guides page. These references might be of interest to later come back to after you've learned Denizen as far as this guide teaches.
